# Supervised Learning

In this part of the course, common approaches for supervised learning were explored including traditional machine learning approaches in addition to deep learning methods.

In this practical task, a deep convolutional neural network was used for classification task using MNIST dataset. The solution was implemented using `pytorch` in Python.

Various data augmentation methods were used in order to increase the generalization of the model during training. Moreover, after obaining the desired results on the public-test subset of the MNIST dataset, the model was tested on a privet-test set that I created which is not from the MNIST dataset, this was done to test the generalization of the trained model.
