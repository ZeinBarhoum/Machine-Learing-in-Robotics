# Data Driven Modellin And Identification

In this part of the course, various data driven modeling and data reduction approaches were implemented.

In terms of modelling and identification, SVD-based linear regression and LASSO regreesion were exlored. On the other hand, for data reduction, reduced SVD based on importance metric, cutoff-threshold and optimal trunction were used for image data reduction and noise fitering. Additionally, PCA and Robust PCA approaches were Investigated.
