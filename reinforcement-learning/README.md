# Reinforcement Learning

In this part of the course, various reinforcement learning approches were taught. In the practical tasks, off-policy and on-policy reinforcement learning models were developed and tested on `CartPole-v0` environment.

For the off-policy methods, deep Q-learning was implemented in its simple form and compared with its modifications that include adding experience reply and target network.

For the on-policy methods, simple policy gradient was implemented without and with ready-to-go.

As an extra task, TRPO algorithm was implemented.
