# Machine-Learing-in-Robotics
This repository contains the code I developed during my Machine Learning in Robotics course at ITMO University.

The course is divided into 5 parts which are:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Localization Filters
3. Data Driven Modelling
4. Evolutionary Algorithms
5. Reinforcement Learning
